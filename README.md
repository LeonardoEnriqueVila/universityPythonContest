# University Python Contest

## Description

This files contains programs that responded to the assignments that the university gave me and my team to solve in a short amount of time, in the context of a Python contest.
Take in mind, that it was not allowed to use modules other than random, and the use of classes was not allowed as well. 
Some files need .txt files to run in order to use them to do things responding to the assignment. The idea here is to showcase the code done in this contest.
